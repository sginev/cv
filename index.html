              I started with UI design mockups and over the last decade went
              deeper and deeper into work, which involved more complex code
              structure, good patterns, and project planning - from one project
              to the next, often requiring skills in new languages, frameworks
              or third-party services, which depending on the product, can be
              immensely exciting.

              about innovative, interesting game or app ideas. Although I
              haven't done official work as such, I also have professional
              interest in, and study as much as I can about game-design.

            <p>
              I have worked on a number of projects both at the office, and at
              home. These include games and apps, realized via different
              technologies for web, android and flash (when it was cool). I
              handle mostly front-end business and visual logic; my back-end
              work consists predominantly of multiplayer server logic, and
              simple rest api and websites.

            <div class="project-tagline">
              <p>
                This is an entirely personal project. As it is a multiplayer
                game, it's being built as a single-page web app for the
                client-side - written in Typescript with React for rendering and
                GSAP handling most of the animations; the server is a node.js
                app, utilizing the beautiful and open-source Colyseus framework
                for room management and communication protocols. Currently, for
                database and authentication I am using Google's Firebase SDK.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most interesting things here are the business logic - special
                effects of played cards need to be able to both respond to a
                large number of possible situations (a custom event system),
                including other cards' activation, as well change the current
                gameplay and rules of the game as effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created in addition a custom card editor as another React app,
                which uses simple forms, the ACE Editor plugin for writing the
                card effects with syntax hight-lighting and custom autocomplete,
                and the Github API for load-saving the data (I chose this
                approach for the commit history).

            <div class="project-tagline">
              <p>
                On this billiard game, I was responsible mainly for the
                game-rules module, implementing the Box2D physics SDK (with some
                custom modifications and prediction work), as well as the
                entirety of the central multiplayer server. For the last, we
                opted to use PlayerIO - an online multiplayer service, where we
                upload our room logic, written in C#.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other than that server, perhaps the most challenging aspects
                were optimizing the physics engine for mobile, as well as the
                very low-level custom shader I had to write, for rendering the
                balls without having to use 3D objects.

                altogether, while keeping as much as possible the openness of a
                traditional computer game.

                Apart from some trigonometry and mock-physics, most of the code
                I wrote for this game relates to tweens and visual effects -

                various browser games, including a 3D casual fight-game, where I
                wrote the client and multiplayer server logic (in actionscript

                for mobile, such as a physics based casual game with map editor,
                skill and reaction games and a smaller projects. Most of these
                titles were designed technically and game-wise by our own team,
                with few pointers or requirements from clients.
