Joined work on a multi-layered online games project; The front end was developed in TypeScript with a WebGL render engine. The back end was mainly completed in C# and .NET; PostgreSQL is used for all databases.

Introduced changes to the build procedure of existing web apps to reduce the final size of scripts and assets and shorten user load-time.

Assisted the team in updating the current development flow with modern tools, including Webpack and Terser Minifier.

Led the development of games and core SDKs packaged as a single TypeScript monorepo. The front end is rendered with PixiJS 5, a WebGL render engine, and communicates with the back end over custom API.
