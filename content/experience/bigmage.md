Other than some of the projects mentioned above, I worked a on various browser games, including a 3D casual fight-game, where I wrote the client and multiplayer server logic (in actionscript and JAVA respectively). We also did a few cross-platform games for mobile, such as a physics based casual game with map editor, skill and reaction games and a smaller projects. Most of these titles were designed technically and game-wise by our own team, with few pointers or requirements from clients.
