Hi!. This is a personal project to create a website to display my resume.

It is a [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Content is written in Markdown and is provided and updated via [TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

Currently, the website is deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The deployment is automated  via **Github Actions** and triggered on push to the `master` branch.
Check out their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more details.
